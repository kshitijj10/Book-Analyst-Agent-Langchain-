So that you make choices in life from a state  of\\nawareness and not ignorance.\\nThis book is a compilation of my thoughts that I have shar ed on\\nsocial media over the past twelve months.\\nMost of which come from my own reflections, my own observat ions,\\nmy own experiences.\\nBack in school we used to play this game called book-cricket.\\nWhere we would open up a book to a random page, and the page\\nnumber would determine how much we scored on that ‘bal l’. I imagine\\nthis book to be one such book-cricket, except we don’t score r uns.\\nInstead, here we are reminded, we put words to our th oughts and we\\nbecome more aware.\\nIf I could make a suggestion, play book-cricket with this boo k.\\nEvery day, open a random page. Read one, maybe three pages.\\nReflect upon them. Maybe make some notes. Or just smile at  how it\\nmade you feel.\\nAnd then come back to it the next day.\\nIf on any day you find yourself saying\\n‘I needed to hear this today’, consider me the bestsellin g author of'),\n",
